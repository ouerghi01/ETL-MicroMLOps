1. Custom Metrics and Alerts

    Custom Metrics: Define and monitor custom metrics specific to your PostgreSQL setup.
    Alert System: Implement a supervised model to classify the severity of alerts based on custom metrics.
    (done)

2. Capacity Planning

    Trend Analysis: Analyze trends in resource usage to predict future needs and plan for scaling.
    Models: Use regression models to estimate future resource requirements based on current and historical usage patterns.

3. Query Performance Optimization

    Workload Classification: Classify types of queries based on their performance characteristics and resource usage.
    Feature Engineering: Extract features like query complexity, execution time, and resource usage.
    Models: Use supervised learning models to predict query performance and suggest optimizations.

4. Resource Utilization Forecasting

    Time-Series Forecasting: Predict future resource usage (CPU, memory, disk) based on historical data.
    Techniques: Apply time-series forecasting models like ARIMA, Prophet, or LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks) for accurate predictions.

5. User Behavior Analysis

    Pattern Recognition: Identify patterns in user interactions with the database, such as query frequency and types.
    Models: Use clustering algorithms to group similar user behaviors and supervised models to predict future user actions based on historical patterns.

Practical Steps

    Data Collection: Ensure you have a robust system for collecting and storing relevant metrics. This might involve enhancing the existing pg_activity data or integrating additional monitoring tools.

    Feature Engineering: Create meaningful features from raw metrics, such as averages, percentiles, or rates of change.

    Model Selection: Choose appropriate supervised learning models based on your specific task (e.g., classification for anomaly detection, regression for forecasting).

    Evaluation and Tuning: Regularly evaluate model performance and adjust hyperparameters to improve accuracy and reliability.

    Integration: Integrate your models into your monitoring systems to provide actionable insights and automate responses to potential issues.

    Documentation and Reporting: Document your findings, model performance, and any insights gained. Create reports to share with your team or stakeholders.

2. SQL-Specific Feature Extraction

    Parse Tree Analysis: SQL queries can be parsed into a tree structure representing the syntax and relationships between elements (tables, columns, etc.). You can then extract features based on the structure (e.g., number of joins, types of subqueries).
        Implementation: Use SQL parsers like sqlparse or sqlglot to parse the query and then traverse the parse tree to extract features.

    Query Plan Analysis: Extract features based on the SQL execution plan (e.g., cost, number of operations). This is useful if you have access to the query execution plans, which give insight into how the query will be executed by the database.
        Implementation: You would need to run EXPLAIN on the queries and then parse the result.

    Query Complexity Metrics: Metrics like the number of tables, the depth of subqueries, the number of columns selected, etc., can be used as features. These are domain-specific and require custom extraction logic.
        Implementation: You can manually code this by parsing SQL queries with sqlparse and counting these elements.
