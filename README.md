# Postgres Monitoring with Hybrid Deep Learning and Real-Time Dashboard

Welcome to the **Postgres Monitoring** repository!

This project is designed to monitor PostgreSQL databases using a hybrid deep learning model that integrates autoencoders and classification models. It features a real-time dashboard to visualize and analyze high-volume data efficiently.

## Features

- **PostgreSQL Monitoring**: Track and analyze database performance and activity.
- **Hybrid Deep Learning Model**: Utilize autoencoders and classification models for advanced data analysis.
- **Real-Time Dashboard**: Interactive and real-time visualization of database metrics and insights.
- **High-Performance Data Processing**: Efficient handling of large datasets for comprehensive monitoring.

## Setup

To get started with this project, you need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine. Once you have them set up, follow these two simple commands to build and run the application:

1. **Build the Docker images**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose build
    ```

2. **Start the services**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

These commands will set up and run all necessary services, including PostgreSQL, Kafka, and the monitoring application.

## Configuration

If you need to change the database configuration or other settings:

1. **Modify Docker Compose**:
    - Open the `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory of the project.
    - Update the environment variables for the PostgreSQL service as needed.

2. **Adjust Application Code**:
    - Navigate to the `ProducerConsumer` directory.
    - Update the relevant configuration files or code to match your specific database setup.

## Usage

After running the setup commands, the system will be up and running with all components connected. You can start monitoring your PostgreSQL database and view real-time analytics through the provided dashboard.

For more details on how to use each component or customize the setup, please refer to the documentation specific to each service and the project's scripts.
